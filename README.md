# Verilog HDL Examples & Assignments  

Welcome to this repository, which provides a curated set of Verilog HDL files and assignments covering fundamental concepts in digital design and modelling.

## 📁 Structure  
- `Behavioural_modelling/` — Verilog modules using behavioural statements (`always`, `if`, `case`, etc.).  
- `Dataflow_modelling/` — Modules modelled using continuous assignments (`assign`) and operators.  
- `assignment/` — Sample exercises and assignments to reinforce learnt concepts.
- `FSM/` — Finite State Machine (FSM) based designs implemented in Verilog. These examples help you understand how to model control logic using states, transitions, and outputs.

## 🧠 Purpose  
This repository is meant for students and hobby-engineers who wish to practise and master Verilog HDL. It complements academic coursework or self-learning in hardware description languages, digital circuits, and design verification.

## ✅ Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Kotesh000/Verilog.git  

Explore the folders.

Use your favourite simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Icarus Verilog) to compile and simulate the modules.

Modify or extend the modules to deepen your understanding of Verilog modelling styles.
